# Awesome‑GEO
Awesome list for research on GEO (Generative Engine Optimization).

# Awesome‑Generative‑Engine‑Optimization  
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), is a paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through flexible optimization frameworks for optimizing and defining visibility metrics.

This is a niche area, which is increasingly receiving attention from the community. This awesome‑listing is an attempt to bring together works in this space. This list is not complete and looking for your PRs to improve it. Thanks!
